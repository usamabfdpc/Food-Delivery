<-------- categories------------>
1)It is good that searched words in category search not disapear
2) The sr#,Category Name ,Packing Fee Status should look like simple link
      *** Use link classes with anchor tag not button tag ***
3)when we click on sort by category name it sort in ascending order but if i again click on it,it should come into descending order.
    I think This is due to get manager_method which changes its url.
      *** Expected Problem Solution Use method="POST" in Form ***
4) when we click on Active then it give all objects which are active but when we click on sorting buttons category name etc it remove all
    filters based  data and show all objects with sorting

    *** Expected Problem Solution Use method="POST" in Form ***
5)âœ…  When we click on all delete radio button all other radio buttons selected
      but when we trying to uncheck all delete this not yet working
      """" Solved  by just adding another if  if(selectAllBtn.checked==false){}"""
